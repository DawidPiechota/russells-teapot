# Russell's teapot instruction

You are a little teapot orbiting the sun.  
Nobody believes that you exist because you are too small for anyone to see you.  
You want to change it.  
Gather more mass by flying through the rings near the planets.  
After you pass through all of them thus gathering enough mass, the final ring near the Earth will become active. Fly through it and let everyone see that you exist.  
Your mission will end.
